_ Mix up all the 52 cards.
_ Deal out all the cards, so that each player has 26.
_ Both players now turn their top card. Whoever turned the higher card takes both cards and adds them to the bottom of their packet.
_ Then both players turn up their next card and so on.
_ If the turned up cards are equal there is a war. Both players play the next card of their pile face down and then another card face-up. Whoever has the higher of the new face-up cards wins the war and adds all six cards face-down to the bottom of their packet. If the new face-up cards are equal as well, the war continues: each player puts another card face-down and one face-up. The war goes on like this as long as the face-up cards continue to be equal. As soon as they are different the player of the higher card wins all the cards in the war. 
_ The game continues until one player has all the cards and wins.
